    <h1></h1>
    <p>It was built in only 10 days in 1995 by a single person, Brendan Eich, who was tasked with building a simple
        scripting language to be used in version 2 of the Netscape browser. It was initially called LiveScript, but
        since the Java language was so popular at the time, the name was changed to JavaScript - although Java and
        JavaScript are in no way related.</p>
    <p>JavaScript as a language is not a completely separate, stand-alone entity. It only exists as an implementation.
        This implementation is known as a JavaScript engine.</p>
    <p>In 1996 Netscape made a deal with the organization known as ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) to
        draft the specification of the JavaScript language, and in 1997 the first edition of the ECMAScript
        specification was published.

        ECMA publishes this specification as the ECMA-262 standard.</p>

    <h1>Conditional Statement</h1>
    <p>
        The JavaScript if-else statement is used to execute the code whether condition is true or false. There are three
        forms of if statement in JavaScript.
    <ul>
        <li> If Statement</li>
        <li> If else statement </li>
        <li> if else if statement</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The JavaScript switch statement is used to execute one code from multiple expressions. It is just like else if
        statement that we have learned in previous page. But it is convenient than if..else..if because it can be used
        with numbers, characters etc.</p>
