    <h4>About different assistive technologies</h4>
    <p> Assistive technologies are devices, software, or equipment that are designed to help people with disabilities
        perform tasks that they would otherwise find difficult or impossible to do. Here are some different types of
        assistive technologies:

        Screen readers: These are software applications that read the text on a computer screen out loud for people who
        are
        visually impaired or blind.

        Braille displays: These are devices that translate the text on a computer screen into braille, allowing people
        who
        are visually impaired or blind to read it through touch.

        Magnifiers: These are software applications or devices that enlarge the text and images on a computer screen for
        people with low vision.

        Speech recognition software: This software allows people with physical disabilities to control their computer
        through spoken commands.

        Alternative input devices: These are devices that allow people with physical disabilities to interact with their
        computer in different ways, such as using a keyboard alternative like a sip-and-puff device, eye-tracking
        technology, or a switch.

        Closed captioning: This is the text transcription of audio in a video or TV program, allowing people who are
        deaf or
        hard of hearing to understand the content.

        Assistive listening devices: These are devices that amplify sound, such as hearing aids or cochlear implants,
        allowing people with hearing loss to hear more clearly.

        These are just a few examples of the many types of assistive technologies available. They can make a huge
        difference
        in the lives of people with disabilities, helping them to perform tasks and participate in activities that they
        may
        not have been able to otherwise. </p>

    When styling a web page, there are many types of selectors available that allow developers to be as broad or as
    specific as they need to be when selecting HTML elements to apply CSS rules to.

    Here you will learn about some of the common CSS selectors that you will use as a developer.
    <br>
    <h4> Element Selectors</h4>
    The element selector allows developers to select HTML elements based on their element type.

    <h4> ID Selectors</h4>
    The ID selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element. Since the id is unique within a webpage, it allows the
    developer to select a specific element for styling. ID selectors are prefixed with a # character.


    <h4> Class Selectors</h4>
    Elements can also be selected based on the class attribute applied to them. The CSS rule has been applied to all
    elements with the specified class name. The class selector is prefixed with a . character.


    <h4> Element with Class Selector</h4>
    A more specific method for selecting HTML elements is by first selecting the HTML element, then selecting the CSS
    class or ID.

    <h4> Descendant Selectors</h4>
    Descendant selectors are useful if you need to select HTML elements that are contained within another selector.


    The CSS rule will select all h1 elements that are contained within the element with the ID blog. The CSS rule
    will not apply to the h1 element containing the text Archives.

    The structure of a descendant selector is a CSS selector, followed by a single space character, followed by
    another CSS selector.
    <br>
    Multiple descendants can also be selected. For example, to select all h1 elements that are descendants of div
    elements which are descendants of the blog element.

    <h4> Child Selectors</h4>
    Child selectors are more specific than descendant selectors. They only select elements that are immediate
    descendants (children) of a selector (the parent).


    If you wanted to style the h1 element containing the text Latest News, you can use the following child selector:
    <br>
    <b> CSS</b>

    #blog > h1 {
    color: blue;
    }
    <br>
    This will select the element with the ID blog (the parent), then it will select all h1 elements that are
    contained directly in that element (the children). The structure of the child selector is a CSS selector
    followed by the child combinator symbol > followed by another CSS selector.
    <br>
    Note that this will not go beyond a single depth level. Therefore, the CSS rule will not be applied to the h1
    element containing the text Today's Weather.

    <h4> :hover Pseudo-Class</h4>
    A special keyword called a pseudo-class allows developers to select elements based on their state. Don't worry
    too much about what that means right now. For now, let's look at how the hover pseudo-class allows you to style
    an element when the mouse cursor hovers over the element.

    The simplest example of this is changing the color of a hyperlink when it is hovered over. To do this, you add
    the
    <h4> :hover pseudo-class to the end of the selector</h4> In the following example, adding :hover to the a element
    will change the color of the hyperlink to orange when it is hovered over.
    <br>
    CSS
    <br>
    a:hover {
    color: orange;
    }
    <br>
    This pseudo-class is very useful for creating visual effects based on user interaction.

    <h4> Other Selectors</h4>
    There are many other CSS selectors available to style your webpage.

    <h4>Text and color in CSS</h4>
    From CSS Version 3, there are five main ways to reference a color.
    <ul>
        By RGB value,

        By RGBA value,

        By HSL value,

        By hex value and

        By predefined color names.

    </ul>
    <h4>RGB</h4>
    RGB is a color model that adds the colors red (R), green (G) and blue (B) together to create colors. This is based
    on how the human eye sees colors.

    Each value is defined as a number between 0 and 255, representing the intensity of that color.

    For example, the color red would have the RGB value of 255,0,0 since the intensity of the red color would be 100%
    while blue and green would be 0%.

    The color black then would be 0,0,0 and the color white 255,255,255.

    When using RGB values in CSS, they can be defined using the rgb keyword:
    <pre>
        p {
           color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
        }
    </pre>

    <h4>RGBA</h4>
    RGBA is an extension of RGB that add an alpha (A) channel. The alpha channel represents the opacity, or
    transparency, of the color.

    Similar to RGB, this is specified in CSS using the rgba keyword:

    <pre>
        p {
          color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 128);
        }
    </pre>
    <h4>HSL</h4>
    HSL is a newer color model defined as Hue (H), Saturation (S) and Lightness (L). The aim of the model is to simplify
    mental visualization of the color that the value represents.

    Think of a rainbow that has been turned into a full circle. This represents the Hue. The Hue value is the degree
    value on this circle, from 0 degrees to 360 degrees. 0 is red, 120 is green and 240 is blue.

    Color gradient palette displaying Hue and Saturation
    Saturation is the distance from the center of the circle to its edge. The saturation value is represented by a
    percentage from 0% to 100% where 0% is the center of the circle and 100% is its edge. For example, 0% will mean that
    the color is more grey and 100% represents the full color.

    Lightness is the third element of this color model. Think of it as turning the circle into a 3D cylinder where the
    bottom of the cylinder is more black and toward the top is more white. Therefore, lightness is the distance from the
    bottom of the cylinder to the top. Again, lightness is represented by a percentage from 0% to 100% where 0% is the
    bottom of the cylinder and 100% is its top. In other words, 0% will mean that the color is more black and 100% is
    white.
    <pre>
        p {
           color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);
        }
    </pre>


    <h4> Hex value</h4>


    Colors can be specified using a hexadecimal value. If you're unfamiliar with hexadecimal, think of it as a different
    number set.

    Decimal is what you use every day. Digits range from 0 to 9 before tens and hundreds are used.

    Hexadecimal is similar, except it has 16 digits. This is counted as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.

    In fact, you can convert between decimal and hexadecimal. Decimal 10 is equal to hexadecimal A. Hexadecimal F is
    equal to decimal 15.

    Hexadecimal can also go to tens and hundreds. For example, decimal 16 is equal to hexadecimal 10, with 10 being the
    next number after F.

    It can be a little confusing at first but don't worry, there are plenty of converters available if you get stuck.

    Colors specified using hexadecimal are prefixed with a # symbol followed by the RGB value in hexadecimal format.

    For example, the color red which is RGB 255,0,0 would be written as hexadecimal #FF0000.

    <h4>Text Font and Size</h4>
    There are many different fonts to display text on your computer. In simple terms, a font is a collection of text
    characters written in a specific style and size.

    If you've used a word processor before, you're probably familiar with the fonts Times New Roman and Calibri.

    To set the font used by text in CSS you use the font-family property.
    <pre>
        p { 
            font-family: "Courier New", monospace;
        }
    </pre>

    <hr>
    <h4>Text Transformation</h4>
    Text transformation is useful if you want to ensure the correct capitalization of the text content. In the example
    below, the CSS rule will change all text in paragraph elements to uppercase using the text-transform property:

    <pre>
        p {
          text-transform: uppercase;
        }
    </pre>
    The most commonly used values for the text-transform property are: uppercase, lowercase, capitalize and none. The
    default value used is none, which means the text displays as it was written in the HTML document.

    <h4>Text Decoration</h4>
    The text-decoration property is useful to apply additional decoration to text such as underlining and line-through
    (strikethrough).

    <pre>
        p {
          text-decoration: underline;
        }
    </pre>
    It is possible to set the color, thickness and styling of the decoration too. In the example below, the underline
    will be a solid red line that is 5 pixels thick.

    <pre>
        p {
        text-decoration: underline red solid 5px;
        }
    </pre>

    If this is confusing, don't worry. These properties can be individually set using the text-decoration-line,
    text-decoration-color, text-decoration-style and text-decoration-thickness properties. Let's use the same example
    again and define it using the individual properties:

    <pre>
        p {
        text-decoration-line: underline;
        text-decoration-color: red;
        text-decoration-style: solid;
        text-decoration-thickness: 5px;
        }
    </pre>
    The most common text-decoration-line values used are: underline, overline, line-through and none. None is the
    default value to use no text decoration.

    There are many styles available for the text-decoration-style property; solid, double, dotted, dashed and wavy. The
    text-decoration-style property requires the decoration line to be defined. If the decoration style is not specified,
    solid will be used.
