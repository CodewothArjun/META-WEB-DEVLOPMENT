    <h1>Errors and Bugs</h1>
    <h3>try{} statement:</h3>
    Here, the code which needs possible error testing is kept within the try block. In case any
    error occur, it passes to the catch{} block for taking suitable actions and handle the error. Otherwise, it
    executes the code written within.
    <h3>catch{} statement:</h3> This block handles the error of the code by executing the set of statements written
    within the block. This block contains either the user-defined exception handler or the built-in handler. This block
    executes only when any error-prone code needs to be handled in the try block. Otherwise, the catch block is skipped.

    <p>
        syntax:
    <pre>
            try{  
                expression; 
              } //code to be written.  

            catch(error){  
                expression;
              } // code for handling the error.  
        </pre>
    </p>
    <h3>throw{} statement:</h3>Throw statements are used for throwing user-defined errors. User can define and throw
    their own custom errors.
    When throw statement is executed, the statements present after it will not execute. The control will directly pass
    to the catch block.
