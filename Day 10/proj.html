        HTML Element Left / Right Alignment

        The two most common ways to left and right align elements are to use the float property and the position
        property.

        The position property has several value options that impact how the element displays in the document flow.
        You'll explore how to use the position property later on. For now, let's focus on the float property.
        <br><br>
        The float property sets an element's position relative to the text content within a parent element. Text will
        wrap around the element.

        In the following example, the image will be aligned to the right of the div element. The text content will wrap
        around the image:
        <br><br>
        HTML element alignment is more complicated than text alignment. To align HTML elements, you must consider the
        box model and document flow from previous lessons. Aligning an HTML element is done by changing the properties
        of its box model and how it impacts the document flow.
