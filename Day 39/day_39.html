    <h3>Define Node </h3>
    <p>Node.js (commonly referred to as Node) is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that
        executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript to build
        server-side applications, as well as command-line tools, desktop applications, and even robotics.</p>

    <h3>Define NPM</h3>
    <p>NPM (short for Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js packages. It allows developers to easily
        install and manage third-party packages or libraries for their Node.js projects. NPM provides a command-line
        interface for developers to search for, download, and install packages, as well as manage versioning and
        dependencies.</p>

    <br>
    <p>In summary, Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside
        of a web browser, while NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages that helps manage dependencies and
        third-party libraries for Node.js projects.</p>
