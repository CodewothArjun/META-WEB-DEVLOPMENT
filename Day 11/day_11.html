    <h2>CSS library and JavaScript library</h2>

    <h2>Framework</h2>
    <p> a framework is a set of pre-written code and guidelines that provides a structure for developers to build
        applications. The main goal of a framework is to facilitate the development process by providing a standard way
        of solving common problems, without having to reinvent the wheel each time.
    <ul>
        <h4> Some key features of a framework include:</h4>

        <li> A collection of reusable components and libraries that can be used to build applications.</li>

        <li> A set of rules and conventions for organizing code and files, which can help developers maintain
            consistency and
            avoid errors.</li>

        <li> Built-in functionality for common tasks, such as handling user input, managing databases, and generating
            HTML/CSS code.</li>

        <li> Extensibility, which allows developers to customize and extend the framework as needed to meet specific
            requirements.</li>

    </ul>

    </p>

    <h2>Libraries</h2>
    <p>
        a library is a collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform specific tasks or functions. Libraries
        are designed to be reusable, meaning they can be called upon by different programs or projects to perform the
        same task, without having to rewrite the code from scratch. <br>

        Some key features of libraries include:

    <ul>
        <li>A collection of functions or modules that can be called upon by programs to perform specific tasks.</li>

        <li>Pre-written code that has been tested and optimized for performance.</li>

        <li>Documentation that explains how to use the library, including information on function parameters, return
            values,
            and usage examples.</li>

        <li>The ability to save time and reduce errors by leveraging pre-existing code rather than writing everything
            from
            scratch.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Responsive</h2>
    <p>A responsive website is a type of website design that is able to adjust and adapt to different screen sizes and
        devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The main goal of responsive web design
        is to provide an optimal user experience, regardless of the device used to access the website.

        The key features of a responsive website include fluid layouts, flexible images, and media queries. A fluid
        layout allows the website to adjust its size and dimensions based on the screen size, while flexible images and
        media queries ensure that all content is displayed correctly and proportionally on all devices.

        Responsive web design is important because it allows businesses to reach a wider audience by ensuring that their
        website is accessible and easy to use on any device. This can improve user engagement and increase conversion
        rates, ultimately leading to greater success for the business.</p>
