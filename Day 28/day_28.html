    <h2>Programming paradigms</h2>
    "There are actually several styles of coding, also known as paradigms. A common style is called functional
    programming, or FP for short. <br>
    Another style is object-oriented programming (OOP). In this style, we group data and functionality as properties and
    methods inside objects.
    <h3>Note: the Functional Programming paradigm works by keeping the data and functionality separate. It's
        counterpart, OOP, works by keeping the data and functionality grouped in meaningful objects.</h3>
