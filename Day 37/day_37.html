    <h3>JavaScript Modules</h3>
    <p>JavaScript modules are a way to organize and encapsulate code into reusable, independent units. Modules allow you
        to break your code into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be easily maintained and tested.</p>
    <h3>DOM Manipulation</h3>
    <p>DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation in JavaScript refers to the process of modifying the HTML and CSS
        content of a web page dynamically through JavaScript code.

        The DOM is a tree-like structure that represents the HTML and CSS content of a web page. Each element in the DOM
        tree is called a node, and these nodes can be accessed, manipulated, and modified using JavaScript.</p>
