    <h1>Using Bootstrap libraries</h1> <br>
    <h3>What is Bootstrap?</h3>
    <p>Bootstrap is a popular open-source framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites and web
        applications. Developed by Twitter, Bootstrap provides a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript templates that can be
        used as a starting point for building modern, responsive web projects.</p>

    <h4> Some key features of Bootstrap include:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li> A grid system for creating flexible, responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.</li>

        <li> Pre-designed UI components, such as buttons, forms, alerts, and navigation menus, that can be easily
            customized
            and
            integrated into projects.</li>

        <li> Built-in support for responsive images, typography, and other design elements.</li>

        <li> Extensibility, which allows developers to customize and extend Bootstrap using their own CSS and
            JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>
