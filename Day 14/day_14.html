    <h1>Static and Dynamic Content</h1>
    <p>Static content refers to web content that remains the same each time it is loaded, regardless of who is accessing
        it or when they are accessing it. Static content can be pre-written text, images, or other media that are stored
        on a server and served to users as they request it. Examples of static content include HTML pages, CSS
        stylesheets, JavaScript files, and image files.

        Dynamic content, on the other hand, refers to web content that is generated on the fly in response to user
        requests. This type of content can be customized to provide a personalized experience for each user, depending
        on their preferences or actions. Examples of dynamic content include search results, social media feeds, weather
        updates, and online shopping carts.

        The key difference between static and dynamic content is that static content is fixed and unchanging, while
        dynamic content is constantly updated and tailored to each user's needs. Dynamic content typically requires more
        processing power and resources than static content, as it must be generated in real-time and delivered quickly
        to users.</p>


    <div>
        <h1>Web server and Application server</h1>
        <p> A web server is responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving static web pages and resources like HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript files, and images to clients. The primary function of a web server is to accept incoming
            HTTP
            requests, locate the requested files or resources, and then send them back to the client's browser.

            An application server, on the other hand, is designed to provide dynamic content and services to clients,
            typically through the use of server-side scripts or application programming interfaces (APIs). Application
            servers provide a framework for hosting and executing applications, which can be accessed over the internet
            or
            an intranet. Application servers are typically used for hosting complex business applications, such as
            online
            banking systems, e-commerce platforms, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.

            While both web servers and application servers can handle HTTP requests, the key difference is that web
            servers
            primarily serve static content, while application servers serve dynamic content and execute server-side
            scripts.
            Application servers also offer advanced features like session management, clustering, caching, load
            balancing,
            and database connectivity, which are typically not provided by web servers.

            In summary, web servers are designed to serve static content, while application servers are designed to
            provide
            dynamic content and execute server-side scripts, making them ideal for hosting complex business
            applications.</p>

        <h1>Single Page Application</h1>
        <p>A "signal page application" refers to a web application or software program that provides a simple and clear
            interface to convey important or actionable information to users. The main point of a signal page
            application is to communicate critical information in a concise and efficient manner, typically through the
            use of visually impactful elements such as colors, icons, and animations.

            Signal page applications are often used in emergency situations or for time-sensitive information, such as
            notifications about system failures or updates on important events. They can also be used in other contexts
            where it's important to convey information quickly and effectively, such as in financial applications that
            display real-time stock market data or in transportation applications that display real-time traffic
            information.

            The key focus of a signal page application is to deliver clear and concise information to the user, without
            overwhelming them with extraneous details or features. This allows the user to quickly understand the
            situation or context, and to take appropriate action if necessary.</p>

        <h1>What is React ?</h1>
        React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which allows developers to create reusable
        components and efficiently update and render the interface based on changes to data. React emphasizes a
        declarative programming style and uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI, resulting in faster and
        smoother user experiences. It is widely used in web development and has a large and active community of
        developers and contributors.
