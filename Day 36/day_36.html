    <h2>Example of data structure</h2>
    <h3> The forEach() method</h3>
    Arrays in JavaScript come with a handy method that allows you to loop over each of their members.
    <h3>The filter() method</h3>
    Another very useful method on the array is the filter() method. It filters your arrays based on a specific test.
    Those array items that pass the test are returned.

    <h3>The map method</h3>
    This method is used to map each array item over to another array's item, based on whatever work is performed inside
    the function that is passed-in to the map as a parameter.


    <h3>spread operator</h3>
    <p>The spread operator, denoted by three dots ( ... ), is a JavaScript syntax feature that allows an iterable
        object, such as an array or string, to be expanded into individual elements.

        The spread operator can be used in a variety of contexts, such as:
    <ol>
        <li>Function calls: The spread operator can be used to pass an array of values as individual arguments to a
            function.</li>

        <li>Array literals: The spread operator can be used to concatenate or copy arrays.</li>

        <li>Object literals: The spread operator can be used to merge objects or copy properties from one object to
            another.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
