    <h2>Box model in css</h2>
    <div class="box">
        The CSS box model refers to the way in which HTML elements are structured and laid out on a web page. Each HTML
        element is essentially a rectangular box that surrounds its content, and this box can be described in terms of
        four layers:

        Content: This layer contains the actual content of the element, such as text, images, or other media.

        Padding: This layer surrounds the content and provides space between the content and the element's border.

        Border: This layer surrounds the padding and provides a visual border around the element.

        Margin: This layer surrounds the border and provides space between the element and adjacent elements on the
        page.

        Together, these layers make up the complete CSS box model for an HTML element. By manipulating the properties of
        these layers using CSS, web developers can control the layout and appearance of their web pages.
