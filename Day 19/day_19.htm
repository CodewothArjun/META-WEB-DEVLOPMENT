    <h1>Comment in JS</h1>
    <h2>Single Line Comment</h2>
    <p>
        A single-line comment is created when you add two forward-slash characters one after the other, without spaces.
    </p>
    <p>Why writing comments is empowering</p>
    <p>With this assumption in mind, consider the effects of what you've just learned, that is, the effects of learning
        how to write comments in JavaScript:

        You can now freely express your ideas about any code that you write.

        You can add comments to any code that already exists.

        Those comments can be intended for your future self, or for colleagues on your development team.</p>
    <p>
        There can be many reasons for that: <br>

        Trying to understand how a given piece of code works.

        Testing different solutions to a coding problem - while not having to delete existing code.

        Debugging - trying to pin-point why your code is broken or behaving unprediticably.
