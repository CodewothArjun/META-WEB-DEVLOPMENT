    <h2>Version Control</h2>
    <p>Version control is a system that helps to manage changes to files, documents, or code over time. It allows
        multiple people to collaborate on a project and keep track of changes made to the project.</p>

    <h3> A history of version control</h3>
    As you know by now, version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that
    you can access specific versions later. In software development, Version Control Systems (VCS) allows developers
    to manage changes to their code and track who made each change. But how did this software come about?

    Version Control has a long history going back to the 1980s. In fact, version control systems were created before
    the Internet!

    One of the first significant Version Control Systems was the Concurrent Versions System (CVS). It was first
    developed in 1986 by Walter F. Tichy at Purdue University and released publicly in 1990.

    CVS stores information about every file in a folder structure, including the name of the file, its location in
    the folder structure, who last modified it, and when it was last modified. The CVS also stores information about
    folders, including their names and who created them.

    It was popular for many years; however, it has some significant flaws in its design. CVS does not include
    integrity checks which means your data can become corrupted. When you update or submit changes to the system, if
    an error occurs, the system accepts the partial or corrupted files. Additionally, the system was designed mainly
    for text files, not binary files such as images or videos.

    The main successor to CVS was Subversion (SVN).

    CollabNet developed Subversion in 2000 and solved many of the issues present in CVS. To ensure data integrity,
    it included integrity checks in its design. It also supported the versioning of binary files better than CVS.
    Thanks to these improvements, SVN became popular in the open-source community with free hosting being offered
    for open-source projects by Google and SourceForge.

    However, Subversion used a centralized VCS model. This means that all operations have to be done using a
    centralized server. If the server were down or slow, this would impede development.

    In 2005, two new projects were started to develop distributed version control systems; Mercurial and Git. Both
    projects were created in response to an event involving the Linux kernel development.

    Previously, the Linux kernel was using a proprietary VCS known as BitKeeper. BitKeeper was one of the first
    distributed version control systems initially released in 2000. BitKeeper had originally provided a free license
    to Linus Torvalds to support Linux’s development. However, in 2005, the license was revoked. This controversy
    led to the creation of the Mercurial and Git projects.

    Mercurial was developed by Olivia Mackal. It is developed as a high-performance distributed VCS. Many platforms
    offering Subversion hosting began to offer Mercurial hosting too. It became popular as Subversion users found it
    easy to transition to a Mercurial repository, thanks to the hosting providers and its small learning curve.

    Git was developed by Linus Torvalds to host the Linux kernel’s source code. Like Mercurial, it is a distributed
    VCS. Its first public release came in 2007.

    Git became popular in the open-source community due to its distributed VCS design and Github offering free Git
    hosting for open-source projects. Git has since become the selected version control system for many open-source
    and proprietary software projects.</p>
